# This is my first program in the 100 days of code challenge
# This program generates a band name given user input of a city and pets name.

# Welcome Statement
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator\n")

# Ask the user for the city they were born in.
cityname = input("What is the name of the city you grew up in?\n")

# Ask the user the name of their pet
petname = input("What is your pets name?\n")

# Print the users new band name
print("Your new band name is The " + cityname + " " + petname +"'s")
